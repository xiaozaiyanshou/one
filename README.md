# Sample Hardhat Project

Contract:https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0x44f7d765924fa1bf60744722c0bdccbb8d5f0846

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
